# Ingestion Insurance Pipeline

## Description

A robust pipeline for healthcare data engineering that:

- Ingests and normalizes data from multiple Electronic Medical Records EMR sources (structured differently).
- Unify the schema into a common format.
- Determines eligibility for claim resubmission based on a combination of deterministic and inferable logic.
